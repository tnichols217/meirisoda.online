## First Entry (test)
_May 26, 2022 â€” edited from original post_

 I've never properly sat down with the intention of blogging, or even journaling for the purpose of it being put online. I do journal regularly, but that is for my eyes only and I have no regard for grammar or the ease of reading because it isn't going anywhere beyond my brain. Recently I've found myself lurking through other people's personal websites and blogs, reading their entries on things they find fascinating, or problems that they have yet to answer. The 'other people' I refer to are people online whose works and creations I admire. In consuming content from these websites, I realized that a lot of the people that I admire in my life, both in-person and online, are very articulate with language. 

I want to be able to utilize language in a way that can clearly communicate my thoughts, and through this I hope that I will learn to articulate myself better and learn to put words to what I'm thinking and feeling. In layman's terms, I'm horrible at writing and organizing my thoughts and most of my entries are going to be a complete mess. But I will try nonetheless. 

Since this is my very first post I want to introduce myself. I go by soda (or meirisoda) online and I am a full-time student pursuing art and creation on the side. I can be found as @meirisoda on Twitter and Instagram, and my website is currently under construction. I like to create illustrations (both digital and traditional), but am very slowly learning other methods of self-expression. These include: 

- learning how to code. Especially html, because I want to create a plethora of small websites that can host my artwork, but also create digital spaces that I feel to be an extension of myself. 
- PureData. I'm a huge fan of generative music, which is why analog synthesizers are so interesting to me, but I don't have the money to pour into a rack. I also think that PD can look super beautiful even though its UI is quite primitive. 
- 3D artwork. This includes programs like Blender, TouchDesigner and also C4D (the last of which I cannot afford). Again, the idea of generative artwork - I want to be able to [use a] program and let the computer interpret what I have given the computer. The idea that something so human(?), something so organic and reflective of nature can be created from a computer is very intriguing to me. I'll probably address this topic in a separate entry, because I think it'll be a very long discussion and also partly because I don't know how to put words to my thoughts on this. 
- drafting (in the architectural sense)! I was actually originally going to go to art school to study either illustration, architecture or industrial design, and I find that a lot of designers, artists or people in general that I admire and wish to be like are somewhat associated with architecture, industrial design or environment. Take Dieter Rams for instance (basic, I know), his designs not only affect the physical appearance and internal workings but also affect the way we interact with these products. The way we perceive what these objects do is affected by the shell that is in and the way that it is presented to us. I think studying architecture and industrial design will help me learn how my illustrations or other artworks are presented to the viewer and how to convey a sense of environment or ambience. 

I'm not quite sure if describing it as a 'sense of environment or ambience' is accurate or has any sort of meaning, but I'll try my best to explain my reasoning behind it. It has always been difficult for me to identify and 'feel' emotions, mine or otherwise. I have a difficult time identifying the emotions presented (especially) through pop music and lyrics. And because of my difficulty with feeling/identifying emotion, I thought I was a sociopath or lacked empathy altogether when in reality, I feel emotion through environment and the ambience. I have to let myself fully experience a moment in time for the 'emotion' to really settle in, for example: when I'm feeling a little hopeless, I turn off all my lights in my room, go under the covers and turn on music. I close my eyes and just listen, which both grounds me (by helping me feel and process my emotions) and also helps me feel like I'm suspended in a separate plane of existence.

I don't know where I was going with this entry. Reiterating what I said in the beginning, I am going to push myself to write more so I can improve. I also think that this method of journaling will prove therapeutic because then I'm forced to fully process my thoughts instead of ignoring them and internalizing them.

To conclude, I want to share some of the websites and people that inspired me to start blogging/journaling online (as well as figure out my place in the online space):
